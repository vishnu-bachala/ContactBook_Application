## ðŸ“¦ Database Setup
1. Create a MySQL database:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE contactdb;
USE contactdb;

CREATE TABLE contacts (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(50)
);
````

2. Update your **DBConnection.java** file with MySQL credentials:

```java
String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/contactdb";
String user = "root";
String password = "your_password";
```
